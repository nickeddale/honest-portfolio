# Honest Portfolio - Competitive Analysis Report

**Date:** December 2025
**Purpose:** Market validation, feature planning, and competitive positioning

---

## Executive Summary

**Honest Portfolio** occupies a unique niche: a free PWA focused specifically on **opportunity cost calculation** for individual stock picks vs. benchmark alternatives (SPY, AAPL, META, GOOGL, NVDA, AMZN). While many portfolio trackers offer benchmark comparison as a secondary feature, none make it the central value proposition with per-purchase drill-down analysis.

### Key Finding
**No direct competitor** offers the exact combination of:
- Per-purchase opportunity cost analysis
- Multiple individual stock benchmarks (not just indices)
- Visual time-series showing "paths diverging"
- Free, simple PWA with no account required

## Recommendations

### For Market Validation:
- **Strong signal:** No direct competitor focuses on per-purchase opportunity cost
- **Validation:** Reddit/forum discussions show users asking "how do I compare my picks to index?"
- **Caution:** Niche appeal; may be too "painful" for some users

### For Feature Planning (Priority Order):

1. **High Value Additions:**
   - Broker integration (Plaid) - eliminates manual entry friction
   - Custom benchmark selection - let users add their own comparison stocks
   - Dividend tracking with reinvestment scenarios

2. **Medium Value:**
   - CSV import/export
   - Native mobile app (vs PWA)
   - Social sharing ("I beat/lost to SPY by X%")

3. **Consider Later:**
   - Tax-loss harvesting suggestions
   - Multiple currencies
   - Crypto support

### For Positioning/Marketing:

**Tagline Ideas:**
- "The portfolio tracker that doesn't lie to you"
- "Would you have been better off with SPY?"
- "Your stock picks vs. what could have been"
- "The regret calculator for investors"

**Key Differentiators to Emphasize:**
1. Only tracker focused on opportunity cost
2. Per-purchase analysis (not just aggregate)
3. Compares to top stocks, not just indices
4. Free, no signup required
5. "Brutal honesty" philosophy
